    <body>
        <p> I am born and raised in Brooklyn, NY and attend Brooklyn Preparatory High School as a senior. I have never lived outside of New York but I am excited to travel! </p>
        <p> Since I was little I always loved animals that I would beg my father consistently to buy my sister and I a puppy. Until this day the answer is still no. </p>
        <p> Although, without his consent I got a kitten! I named her Ginger and she's almost 2! </p>
        <p> As you can tell I am very determined when I want something to occur. I am also persistent and hard working. </p>
        <p> I have never thought of computer science and coding but look at me now. Though I still picture myself being a veterinarian, I can also see myself work in the technology field.</p>
